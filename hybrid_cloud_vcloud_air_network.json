Developing security boundaries for virtual machines that house this data and the applications that run in them is a challenge even in the private cloud. When expanding security context to the hybrid cloud, the need to introduce controls providing assurances that administrators are not able to compromise the privacy of the regulated data is paramount. If your organization is looking at leveraging the hybrid cloud to gain additional capacity for running workloads, you\u0027d like to uncover a way to make that a possibility across all workload types, including those that are regulated. In order to establish appropriate trust mechanisms for control in the public cloud, many organizations turn to encryption solutions to enforce attestation to things geolocation that helps to address EU privacy and data residency laws. But which types of solutions best fit the operational model of the hybrid cloud giving optimal freedom of workload mobility while maintaining privacy and compliance? As a vCloud Air Network service provider you want to make this as simple as possible employing what Gartner calls a Cloud Security Gateway, cloud-based security policy enforcement points placed between cloud service consumers and cloud service providers to interject enterprise security policies as resources are accessed. In this session learn about HyTrust products that fit the cloud security gateway model and provides appropriate levels of control for running these workloads on premise and at VMware vCloud Air Network service providers.

For example, for a multi-national organization to address data sovereignty laws in the EU, Canada, and other jurisdictions, they must develop mechanisms to ensure regulated data is encrypted at birth, and then controlled in a way that prevents it from being decrypted outside a specified geographic boundary. As a security best practice, the organization may also wish to keep the encryption keys on-premises, or otherwise in a location separate from the data. For organizations to meet regulatory requirements such as PCI-DSS and HIPAA in the cloud, and to cost-effectively deal with each audit cycle, the organization cloud vendor must install automated controls that ensure hypervisor integrity and configuration control, granular admin access controls, logging of administrative activity, and data encryption. Yet that is not enough - the cloud vendor must also be able to produce the evidence of these controls, including forensic-quality log reports, upon demand by the tenant or auditor.  What is required is an ecosystem-based approach, leveraging best-of-breed technologies that are integrated and offered as a unified cloud service. The combination of IBM cloud automation innovations, ecosystem partnerships, and system integration expertise have enabled IBM to deliver the industry first hardware-assisted, Secure and Compliant Cloud running on VMware, integrating innovations from Intel and HyTrust. In this session, you will learn how IBM, Intel, and HyTrust have co-engineered this unified cloud solution running on VMware, built upon a \u0026ldquo;hardware root of trust\u0026rdquo;, for deployment on-premises, off-premises in SoftLayer, or in hybrid fashion.","AirDateDisplay":"Tuesday, August 30, 2016","AirTimeDisplay":"3:30 PM PDT","FullStartDate":"08/30/2016 15:30:00","FullEndDate":"08/30/2016 16:17:24","TimeZoneId":"52","DurationDisplay":"47 Minutes 24 Seconds ","PlayerUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Play/548ae97aedcd4ec6b90d45e4229ee8d01d?catalog=dbf1ec28-2557-4dd3-a381-e5fe4ceabc40\u0026authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","ModerateUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Moderate/548ae97aedcd4ec6b90d45e4229ee8d01d","SlideFormatUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/dd1f304b1e5949ebb8ac3a1148b1f97629/Presentation/548ae97aedcd4ec6b90d45e4229ee8d01d/slide_{0:D4}_500_375.jpg?authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","ThumbnailImageUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/548ae97aedcd4ec6b90d45e4229ee8d01d/d1df72f2-85b5-40eb-8c32-f59387c537f6_500_282.jpg?authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","PresenterImageUrl":null,"PresentationContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/548ae97aedcd4ec6b90d45e4229ee8d01d","PresenterContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presenter/9b194ea8a8294495b76bddb198e760782a","DownloadUrls":[],"CardImageIsThumbnail":true,"StatusDisplay":"On Demand","Status":5,"IsShortcut":false,"IsViewableOnDemand":true,"IsPrivate":false,"IsLive":false,"IsOnDemand":true,"SlideCount":0,"FolderId":"fa3d2bc5-fefe-4ef2-a349-b740571ffc49","Presenters":[{"Id":"3ac4d266519f4052a5343dbe58aa93d92a","Name":"Eric Chiu, HyTrust, Inc.","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Eric Chiu, HyTrust, Inc.","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":-151334475,"ParentResource":"548ae97a-edcd-4ec6-b90d-45e4229ee8d0"},{"Id":"afbc471e53524830bf4f3d0747f3c4752a","Name":"Simon Kofkin-Hansen, IBM","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Simon Kofkin-Hansen, IBM","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":-1377421853,"ParentResource":"548ae97a-edcd-4ec6-b90d-45e4229ee8d0"},{"Id":"82e7618fd4204fce8eb8eb4be80174b62a","Name":"Raghu Yeluri, Intel Corp","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Raghu Yeluri, Intel Corp","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":-1159778467,"ParentResource":"548ae97a-edcd-4ec6-b90d-45e4229ee8d0"}],"SupportingLinks":[],"Tags":[" Breakout Session"," Technical – Introductory","Hybrid Cloud"," Cloud Management, vCloud Air Network"],"IsEditable":false,"IsPublishable":false,"CanModerate":false,"AllowPresentationDownload":false,"Available":true,"TimelineHits":null,"Views":7},{"Id":"adfee9dfd65a4128922e0f1632e4248d1d","Name":"HBC7999 - VMware Availability for VCAN: Native vSphere Replication","PresentationRootId":"adfee9df-d65a-4128-922e-0f1632e4248d","Description":"VMware vCloud Air Network (VCAN) service providers are offering a new disaster recovery as a service solution leveraging new VMware availability technologies.

Cloud can be a valuable extension of existing IT capabilities. Backup solutions can archive data to a cloud environment automatically; server and desktop workloads can run on-prem or in a private cloud. Supplementing IT resources when and where required is real value of hybrid cloud. Hybrid management takes the concept further. Managing workloads includes numerous tedious tasks: monitoring, patching, anti-virus, backups, etc. A managed cloud provider can liberate you to delegate some of these tasks, while continuing to oversee the tasks you want to maintain. All-or-nothing management is inflexible. Granular, hybrid management can eliminate concerns of not being able to take advantage of legacy investments in existing tools, processes and expertise.

New datacenters are based on the Hyper-Converged architecture which eliminates the need for dedicated servers for storage systems (such as SAN). Servers that are used in such Hyper-Converged deployments usually contain multiple CPUs and large storage capacity. Modern CPUs have double-digit cores that enable the servers to supports tens or even hundreds of VMs. Those servers also have a higher number of PCIe slots, which enables the NVMe storage to be used as well the ability to host 24 or 48 SAT/SATA SSDs, both of which result in extremely high storage capacity. This session provides an overview of the benefits that vSphere based Hyper-Converged architecture enables. It suggests ways to increase the efficiency using the new built-in capabilities included in vSphere, specifically with choosing the right networking technologies that can support up to 100GbE and Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA), that enable running the compute and storage traffic over a single wire, without bottlenecks and maximize the CPU utilization, which results in higher efficiency. It will include an introduction to RDMA technology, a deep-dive into ESXi RDMA Architecture and RoCE Driver Development. We will highlight the salient features of the ESXi RDMA Device layer, binding management between kernel network interfaces and RDMA devices, and vendor driver requirements to conform to the Driver model. We will also present the public RDMA API, specifically, the key interfaces and data structures, and show how to plug in a vendor driver into the native RDMA layer. We will conclude with touching upon the support in ESXi RDMA stack to develop a Native RDMA ULP.","AirDateDisplay":"Monday, August 29, 2016","AirTimeDisplay":"5:30 PM PDT","FullStartDate":"08/29/2016 17:30:00","FullEndDate":"08/29/2016 18:01:28","TimeZoneId":"52","DurationDisplay":"31 Minutes 28 Seconds ","PlayerUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Play/4a5122ea31574d719e751fe8a1d14fc21d?catalog=dbf1ec28-2557-4dd3-a381-e5fe4ceabc40\u0026authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","ModerateUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Moderate/4a5122ea31574d719e751fe8a1d14fc21d","SlideFormatUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/dd1f304b1e5949ebb8ac3a1148b1f97629/Presentation/4a5122ea31574d719e751fe8a1d14fc21d/slide_{0:D4}_500_375.jpg?authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","ThumbnailImageUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/4a5122ea31574d719e751fe8a1d14fc21d/f7812e03-abaf-4aa8-b4e3-322d83000a38_500_282.jpg?authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","PresenterImageUrl":null,"PresentationContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/4a5122ea31574d719e751fe8a1d14fc21d","PresenterContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presenter/9b194ea8a8294495b76bddb198e760782a","DownloadUrls":[],"CardImageIsThumbnail":true,"StatusDisplay":"On Demand","Status":5,"IsShortcut":false,"IsViewableOnDemand":true,"IsPrivate":false,"IsLive":false,"IsOnDemand":true,"SlideCount":0,"FolderId":"fa3d2bc5-fefe-4ef2-a349-b740571ffc49","Presenters":[{"Id":"1b4cada9689c4c41b9ca2f3bf396a8c02a","Name":"Liran Liss, Mellanox Technologies","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Liran Liss, Mellanox Technologies","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":616318197,"ParentResource":"4a5122ea-3157-4d71-9e75-1fe8a1d14fc2"},{"Id":"42afcfaf303648dca63a035085290f4f2a","Name":"Aviad Shaul Yehezkel, Mellanox","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Aviad Shaul Yehezkel, Mellanox","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":2094395936,"ParentResource":"4a5122ea-3157-4d71-9e75-1fe8a1d14fc2"}],"SupportingLinks":[],"Tags":[" Breakout Session"," Technical – Advanced","Hybrid Cloud"," vCloud Air Network"],"IsEditable":false,"IsPublishable":false,"CanModerate":false,"AllowPresentationDownload":false,"Available":true,"TimelineHits":null,"Views":2},{"Id":"225c905abf6748b78a9fba031e11415d1d","Name":"HBC7954 - Implementing Hybrid Cloud with VMware vCloud Air and NSX: A Closer Look","PresentationRootId":"225c905a-bf67-48b7-8a9f-ba031e11415d","Description":"On-premises network deployments are complex designs that have been perfected over time, and most of these designs take a layered approach with a hub-and-spoke pattern.

Successful service providers will be those that adopt a hybrid cloud model which actually delivers what enterprises are looking for. Instead of treating on-premise and service provider cloud as separate worlds - with the occasional need to burst from the former to the latter - enterprise clients are adopting a much more fluid approach. The hybrid cloud model, for an enterprise, needs to deliver the ability to optimize workload placement for price, performance, compliance, scale and locality - in real time - according to business need. That requires an all-encompassing approach to cloud management, that embraces multiple hypervisor technologies, multiple server types, and multiple locations across on-premise private cloud infrastructure, and service provider public clouds. It requires bringing all these service types into a single management and provisioning environment, where workloads can be deployed and moved to the best infrastructure, on the best virtualization platform, in the best location for the task at hand. And it requires the hybrid cloud to act as a glue that enables enterprises to pool their private resources, and service providers to pool their public resources - bringing them together in a way that guarantees security, transparency and fluidity. This session will explore the business and technology characteristics of this hybrid cloud model, and show how OnApp\u0027s hybrid multi-cloud, multi-hypervisor, federated approach to a cloud management platform enables vCAN partners to offer the fluidity and control their enterprise customers need - for the mutual benefit of everyone in the hybrid cloud ecosystem.","AirDateDisplay":"Monday, August 29, 2016","AirTimeDisplay":"11:30 AM PDT","FullStartDate":"08/29/2016 11:30:00","FullEndDate":"08/29/2016 12:15:24","TimeZoneId":"52","DurationDisplay":"45 Minutes 24 Seconds ","PlayerUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Play/8939ef15d51345bfb89847f206ce54431d?catalog=dbf1ec28-2557-4dd3-a381-e5fe4ceabc40\u0026authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","ModerateUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Moderate/8939ef15d51345bfb89847f206ce54431d","SlideFormatUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/8939ef15d51345bfb89847f206ce54431d/slide_{0:D4}_500_375.jpg?authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","ThumbnailImageUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/8939ef15d51345bfb89847f206ce54431d/64f8909f-aecd-4adc-988d-b129c87c8237_500_282.jpg?authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","PresenterImageUrl":null,"PresentationContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/8939ef15d51345bfb89847f206ce54431d","PresenterContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presenter/9b194ea8a8294495b76bddb198e760782a","DownloadUrls":[],"CardImageIsThumbnail":true,"StatusDisplay":"On Demand","Status":5,"IsShortcut":false,"IsViewableOnDemand":true,"IsPrivate":false,"IsLive":false,"IsOnDemand":true,"SlideCount":0,"FolderId":"fa3d2bc5-fefe-4ef2-a349-b740571ffc49","Presenters":[{"Id":"58cd0b55ba744037ab81d3c9185fd9c12a","Name":"Narendar Shankar, OnApp Inc","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Narendar Shankar, OnApp Inc","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":832595149,"ParentResource":"8939ef15-d513-45bf-b898-47f206ce5443"},{"Id":"b4b58155b44643119e8821c9dd6966d42a","Name":"Alistair Wildman, OnApp","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Alistair Wildman, OnApp","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":-1234877728,"ParentResource":"8939ef15-d513-45bf-b898-47f206ce5443"}],"SupportingLinks":[],"Tags":[" Business Solutions"," Breakout Session","Hybrid Cloud"," vCloud Air Network"],"IsEditable":false,"IsPublishable":false,"CanModerate":false,"AllowPresentationDownload":false,"Available":true,"TimelineHits":null,"Views":8},{"Id":"8b2d75dc05af4f5cbf5acd3e3de9ffe11d","Name":"HBC8046-QT - Customer Onboarding with VMware NSX L2VPN Service for VMware vCloud Air Network","PresentationRootId":"8b2d75dc-05af-4f5c-bf5a-cd3e3de9ffe1","Description":"One of the initial concerns about moving to a hybrid cloud solution is determining the methods that will be used for onboarding into a service provider infrastructure. In many cases, customers will have a requirement of migrating systems with changing IP addresses or deploying new workloads to a service provider\u0027s infrastructure while maintaining layer 2 connectivity with existing on-premises workloads. This session will examine some of the key prerequisites and scenarios in which VMware vCloud Air Network providers can leverage the VMware NSX L2VPN service to streamline the process for customers who are onboarding to a vCloud Air Network hybrid cloud solution. Where applicable, vCloud Air Network partners can enhance the customer onboarding process by offering hybrid network connectivity, seamless migration, and workload mobility services that help customers adopt the hosted cloud platform with less risk and less impact to their running applications\u0026mdash;all without the need for changing IP addresses after relocating to the vCloud Air Network hosted environment. This solution can also be leveraged for migrations in which only a portion of the workloads are being migrated but still need layer 2 access to other systems that remain on the customer premises.","AirDateDisplay":"Sunday, August 28, 2016","AirTimeDisplay":"4:00 PM PDT","FullStartDate":"08/28/2016 16:00:00","FullEndDate":"08/28/2016 16:36:07","TimeZoneId":"52","DurationDisplay":"36 Minutes 7 Seconds ","PlayerUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Play/8b2d75dc05af4f5cbf5acd3e3de9ffe11d?catalog=dbf1ec28-2557-4dd3-a381-e5fe4ceabc40\u0026authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","ModerateUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/Moderate/8b2d75dc05af4f5cbf5acd3e3de9ffe11d","SlideFormatUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/8b2d75dc05af4f5cbf5acd3e3de9ffe11d/slide_{0:D4}_500_375.jpg?authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","ThumbnailImageUrl":"http://vmware.mediasite.com/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/8b2d75dc05af4f5cbf5acd3e3de9ffe11d/475bb60f-8e14-4fa4-9893-14f9b7ac1595_500_282.jpg?authTicket=800C1C2735DCCDD60586A7AA51D54FCE","PresenterImageUrl":null,"PresentationContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presentation/8b2d75dc05af4f5cbf5acd3e3de9ffe11d","PresenterContentUploadUrl":"/mediasite/FileServer/Presenter/9b194ea8a8294495b76bddb198e760782a","DownloadUrls":[],"CardImageIsThumbnail":true,"StatusDisplay":"On Demand","Status":5,"IsShortcut":false,"IsViewableOnDemand":true,"IsPrivate":false,"IsLive":false,"IsOnDemand":true,"SlideCount":0,"FolderId":"fa3d2bc5-fefe-4ef2-a349-b740571ffc49","Presenters":[{"Id":"eaf4ea9b2c9b43e5a2d19e0b14655b792a","Name":"Harold Simon, VMware","Prefix":null,"FirstName":"","MiddleName":"","LastName":"Harold Simon, VMware","Suffix":null,"BioUrl":null,"Email":"","ImageName":null,"ImageUrl":null,"AdditionalInfo":"","Hash":-24657465,"ParentResource":"8b2d75dc-05af-4f5c-bf5a-cd3e3de9ffe1"}],"SupportingLinks":[],"Tags":[" Technical – Introductory"," Quick Talk","Hybrid Cloud"," vCloud Air Network"],"IsEditable":false,"IsPublishable":false,"CanModerate":false,"AllowPresentationDownload":false,"Available":true,"TimelineHits":null,"Views":11},{"Id":"923e94d5f9dd45e79fa9e1f2aa7074641d","Name":"HBC7661-QT - Generate Revenue with vSphere Optimization Assessment (VOA) for Service Providers","PresentationRootId":"923e94d5-f9dd-45e7-9fa9-e1f2aa707464","Description":"Grow your VMware Cloud Management and Services business by delivering a 21-day proof-of-concept engagement to demonstrate the power of vRealize Operations.
